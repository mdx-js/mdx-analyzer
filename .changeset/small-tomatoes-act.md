Add improved syntax highlighting grammar

This now pulls in a grammar for from:
<https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-tm-language>.

It fixes a bunch of previous errors and adds real support for MDX.
It also supports YAML frontmatter, TOML frontmatter, GFM (autolink
literals, footnotes, strikethrough, tables, tasklists), GitHub (gemoji,
mentions, references).
Thereâ€™s support for about 20 common embedded grammars in fenced code
blocks.
Embedded code (in fenced code blocks, or in ESM/expressions) is now
marked as being the correct language, which makes comments and such
work.
