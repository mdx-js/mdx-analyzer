## Contributions

Thereâ€™s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.
If you have questions, see [Â§ Support][support].
If you can provide financial support, see [Â§ Sponsor][sponsor].

### Improve docs

As a user youâ€™re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, arenâ€™t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
You can help by trying to make them easier to resolve.
Existing issues might benefit from your unique experience or opinions.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.
Itâ€™s probably a good idea to first post a question or open an issue to report a
bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request.

## Submitting an issue

* The issue tracker is for issues.
  Use discussions for support
* Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new issue
* Ensure youâ€™re using the latest version of our packages
* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue, error
  message, version, operating system, etcetera
* The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you
* The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

* See [Â¶ Project][project] below for info on how the project is structured,
  how to test, and how to build the site
* Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you
  from doing unnecessary work
* For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the community
  for feedback as soon as possible
* New features should be accompanied by tests and documentation
* For significant changes, add a [changeset][] using the `npx changeset` command
* Donâ€™t include unrelated changes
* Test before submitting code by running `npm test`
* Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
  itâ€™s your job to convince us

## Project

### Structure

MDX is a monorepo.
All packages are in `packages/`.
The `fixtures/` directory contains some workspaces that are used for testing
and debugging.

### Debug

You may use any editor you want.
But since this project contains a [Visual Studio Code][vscode] extension, itâ€™s
most convenient to use Visual Studio Code.
This project contains a debugging configuration for Visual Studio Code.
From within the editor, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to build and debug the extension.
This will open the [fixtures](./fixtures/fixtures.code-workspace) workspace with
a new profile.
Use the [Volar Labs][] extension to inspect virtual code.

### Tests

To run the tests, first do `npm install`, then do `npm test`.
This ensures everything is okay, from code style to unit tests to types.

### Release

Releases are managed by [changesets][changeset].
If changesets are available, a bot will create a pull request.
Merge this pull request to make a release.
This will update the changelogs, publish the packages to npm, publish the Visual
Studio Code extension to the [marketplace][], and create GitHub releases.
