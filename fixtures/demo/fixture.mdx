# MDX intellisense

## What is MDX?

[MDX][mdx] allows you to write JSX and ESM inside your markdown. This means you
can use the full power of a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org) while
you focus on content. ðŸ¤¯

### Markdown

Because MDX is based on markdown, you can leverage the full power of markdown, such as

- lists
- `code`
- _italic_
- and **bold** markup.

### Imports

For example, you can write JavaScript imports and exports like so:

import { Avatar } from './components/Avatar.js'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Blog Post',
}

You can even declare functions

export function sayHi() {
  console.log('Hello from MDX!')
}

### JavaScript expressions and JSX

The real power of MDX is the power to mix markdown with JavaScript and JSX.

For example, the following will render an avatar.

<Avatar
  avatar={props.avatar}
  name={props.name}
/>

And everyone likes {Math.PI} ðŸ¥§.

## Intellisense

Ok cool, we now understand the basics of MDX. I like a smart editor. How do we get that to work?

Well, MDX supports comments too. {/** This comment is ignored */}

MDX leverages TypeScriptâ€™s [JSDoc types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html)
to provide intellisense.

To get type safety for props, define the `Props` type.

{/**
  * @typedef {object} Props
  * @property {string} avatar
  * A link to the userâ€™s profile image
  * @property {string} name
  * The userâ€™s display name.
  * @property {Date} birthdate
  * When the user was born.
  */}

If you hover over the props below, youâ€™ll see the types are checked.

<Avatar
  avatar={props.avatar}
  birthdate={props.birthdate}
  name={props.name}
/>

Born: {props.birthdate}

Also {props.invalidProps} will be marked as such.
